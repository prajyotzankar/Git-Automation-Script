> This script automates various Git operations including backing up changed files, syncing the codebase with a remote repository, and committing and pushing changes to the current branch. It is designed to streamline the development process by handling repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Clone or Download

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-automation-script.git
```

## Usage

1. **Navigate to your local Git repository**:

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/repository
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```sh
   chmod +x path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   ./path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

## Script Workflow

1. **Set Destination Folder**:

   - Determines the destination folder based on the current branch.
   - Creates the folder if it doesn't exist.

2. **Backup Changed Files**:

   - Identifies modified and untracked files with the extensions `.jsp`, `.xsd`, and `.java`.
   - Copies these files to the destination folder.

3. **Sync Codebase with Remote**:

   - Clears any existing stash.
   - Stashes current changes.
   - Switches to the main branch and pulls the latest changes.
   - Switches back to the current branch and rebases it with the main branch.
   - Applies the stashed changes.

4. **Add, Commit, and Push Changes**:
   - Displays the files to be added.
   - Prompts for confirmation before staging the files.
   - Prompts for a commit message and commits the changes.
   - Pushes the changes to the current branch.

## Customization

- **Main Branch**: The script uses `MAIN_BRANCH` as the main branch. You can change this by modifying the `main_branch` variable.
- **File Extensions**: The script currently backs up files with `.jsp`, `.xsd`, and `.java` extensions. You can add or remove extensions by updating the regular expression in the `get_changed_files_and_backup` function.

## Project Status

> The script is functional and can be customized based on specific project requirements.
